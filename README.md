# Classification-and-Regression-tasks-by-establishing-DNN-MLP-architectures
Part one regression:
1-	Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques
Download the dataset from Kaggle and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Look through the columns and rows to understand what data points are available.
•	For EDA, we need to understand the dataset by visualizing and summarizing key aspects of the data. This will involve:
•	Loading the Dataset: Start by loading the dataset and understanding its structure.
•	Checking for Missing Values: See if there are any missing values and decide how to handle them.
•	Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
•	Visualizing Distributions: Use histograms, box plots, and density plots to understand the distributions of the variables.
•	Correlation Heatmap: This helps to understand the relationships between features.

2-	Deep Neural Network Architecture using PyTorch
In this part, we will define a neural network for regression using PyTorch. This architecture should handle numerical predictions
Preprocessing the Data:

Normalize/Scale the Data: Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to normalize the input features.
Split the Data: Use train_test_split from sklearn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Define the Neural Network Architecture:

Use PyTorch to define a simple DNN or MLP (e.g., using nn.Sequential).
Typical architecture may include layers like:
Input Layer
Hidden Layers with nn.Linear and activation functions like nn.ReLU
Output Layer for regression (usually without an activation function).
Training Setup:

Loss Function: Use Mean Squared Error (nn.MSELoss()) as the loss function for regression tasks.
Optimizer: Start with a basic optimizer like Adam or SGD.
Hyperparameters: Set initial values for learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Train the Model:

Write a training loop to:
Forward pass: compute predictions
Compute loss
Backward pass: update weights using optimizer
Track loss for each epoch to visualize later.

 3-	Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearch

 Define Hyperparameter Grid:
Specify a range of values for parameters like learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, and batch size.
Apply GridSearch:
Since GridSearchCV doesn’t directly support PyTorch, you’ll need to use a wrapper around your PyTorch model (like sklearn’s BaseEstimator and RegressorMixin) or implement a custom grid search loop.

We can use GridSearchCV from scikit-learn to find the best hyperparameters. For a deep neural network, hyperparameters can include learning rate, optimizer, and the number of epochs. However, since GridSearchCV works with scikit-learn models and not PyTorch directly, you would typically use sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor for grid search, or manually loop through combinations of hyperparameters in PyTorch.

4-	Visualize Loss and Accuracy over Epochs
In PyTorch, you can track the loss and accuracy during training. 

Plot Training and Validation Loss:

Plot loss vs. epochs for both training and testing data to observe overfitting or underfitting.
Plot Training and Validation Accuracy (Optional for Regression):

For regression, accuracy is not typically tracked, but you could plot R² score or other metrics against epochs.
Interpret the Results:

Analyze if the model improves over epochs, if it converges, or if there’s any sign of overfitting.

5-	Regularization Techniques

L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):

Add weight decay to the optimizer in PyTorch to help reduce overfitting.
Dropout:

Add nn.Dropout layers between hidden layers in your network and experiment with different dropout probabilities.
Batch Normalization:

Add nn.BatchNorm1d layers after each linear layer to stabilize and speed up training.
Compare Results:

Evaluate the performance of the regularized model compared to the initial one, ideally showing improved generalization on the test set.

PART 2 multi class classification:

1- Pre-processing Techniques (Data Cleaning and Normalization/Standardization)
Preprocessing:
We will:

Handle missing values.
Normalize/Standardize the data (especially numerical columns).
Convert categorical variables to numeric representations using one-hot encoding (if necessary).

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps us understand the structure of the dataset. We will:

Visualize the distributions of features.
Analyze class distributions.
Visualize correlations and feature importance.

3-  Data Augmentation Techniques
For imbalanced datasets, we can use techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling

4- Deep Neural Network Architecture
We'll create a neural network using PyTorch to handle the multi-class classification task. Since this is a classification task, we will use CrossEntropyLoss.

5-. Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearch
We can use GridSearchCV from scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning. It can help you find the best combination of learning rate, optimizers, and other hyperparameters.


6- Visualization of Loss and Accuracy Graphs
We’ll plot the loss and accuracy over epochs to visualize training and testing performance


7- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Sensitivity, F1 Score)
We will calculate metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score using scikit-learn.

8- egularization Techniques and Comparison
Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (weight decay), dropout, or batch normalization can be added to the network to prevent overfitting.
